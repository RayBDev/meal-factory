Meal Factory is a single page recipe application that allows for searching and storing recipes as well as creating an ingredient shopping list.

## :bookmark_tabs: Technologies Used

1.  **HTML5 & CSS3**

    The layout makes use of HTML5 semantic elements as well as pure CSS3 (no frameworks).

2.  **JavaScript**

    Meal Factory is written in ES6 using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. While I generally use React/NextJS/Gatsby for development, this project is an attempt at a frameworkless design.
